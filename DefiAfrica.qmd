## **What Is DEFI?**

In the traditional (legacy or fiat) financial system or a sexier name i.e. Tradfi, the exchange of value is often relegated to centralized entities such as your bank or an even bigger authority like the central bank in the country. These authorities control the in-flow and out-flow of value (money, investments, debits/credits) to and from your bank account or any payment wallet, which has a central point of failure for your financial transactions.

DeFi is the exact opposite of what you see in the Tradfi case. Imagine DeFi as a magical digital playground where you can do money stuff without your regular banks. Instead of bankers, you have computer programs called smart contracts. These smart contracts follow the rules, like a friendly robot banker.

You can:

Lend: You let others borrow your crypto and earn money from it.

Borrow: You borrow crypto by putting something valuable as a pledge.

Trade: You swap one cryptocurrency for another, like trading your toys with friends.

Earn Rewards: You can earn rewards for helping others trade their crypto.

It's like a digital adventure with lots of ways to make, use, and grow your digital money, and it's open for everyone to explore! But be careful, just like any adventure, there are also risks, so you need to be smart and cautious while playing in this magical digital world.

**How about a DeX?**

:   Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are cryptocurrency platforms that are designed to facilitate transactions without intermediaries. This enable users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with each other, without the need for central control over funds. DEXs are powered by smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts that are stored on a blockchain through the use of Automated Market Makers (AMMs).

Automated market makers (AMMs) are a type of Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) that uses smart contracts (algorithms) to create liquidity pools (LP). The AMM uses an algorithm to determine the price of the tokens based on the ratio of the two assets in the liquidity pool.

Cryptocurrencies are traded like traditional assets for investments, trading, risk management, payments, accessing new projects, and regulatory compliance. They're known for high returns and high volatility, making them attractive for trading. They can hedge against risks, facilitate online payments, and offer access to unique assets and projects while adhering to regulations.

**Traditional Way-Order Book**

An order book lists buy and sell orders for an asset, revealing supply and demand. Traders use it for informed decisions, and each order has type, price, quantity, and time. Orders are matched by price and time-stamp. In centralized exchange markets, order books provide transparency and set prices.

**LIQUIDITY POOLS (LP)**

Liquidity pools are collections of tokens that are locked in a smart contract. When a user wants to trade tokens on an AMM, they trade directly with the liquidity pool. Prices in a liquidity pool are determined by arbitrageurs who help balance the real world prices of cryptocurrencies in centralized exchanges with on-chain data in smart contracts.

Liquidity pools are a crucial part of decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, SushiSwap, Bancor, etc. They enable users trade digital assets without needing a traditional order book. They also play a significant role in DeFi by allowing users to earn passive income through providing liquidity while facilitating the trading of various cryptocurrencies.

Here is how they work:

A Liquidity provider deposits a combination of tokens (usually 2) into a pool according to a particular formula to earn proportional trading fees when other traders use the pool for trading.

Liquidity pools are based on the following Automatic Market Maker (AMM) algorithms (models).

**Constant Product AMMS**

:   The pool uses a mathematical formula known as the constant product formula to determine the exchange rate and pricing for the assets in the pool.

    In a simple form, the formula is:

    $$ 
    Token A * Token B = Constant (K) 
    $$

    This formula ensures that the product of the reserves remains constant, which means that as one side of the pool is traded for the other, the relative prices adjust automatically.

    The price of an asset in the pool is determined by the ratio of the reserves. If more of one asset is bought, its price in relation to the other asset increases, and vice versa. This mechanism allows traders to swap one asset for another at a dynamic market price without the need for a traditional order book.

**Constant Sum AMMs**

:   Constant Sum LPs maintain a sum of reserves in the pool. Constant Sum AMM provides an alternative approach to market making compared to Constant Product LPs. They are designed to maintain a constant total value in the pool, which can be useful for assets with different valuation dynamics.

    Here is the mathematical relationship (formula):

    $$ Token A + Token B= Constant (K) $$

**Hybrid AMMs**

:   Hybrid AMMs are a type of automated market maker (AMM) that combine elements of Constant Sum AMM and Constant Product AMM designs. This is done in order to address the limitations of individual AMM designs, and to create a more efficient and user-friendly trading experience.

    In Uniswap V3, Liquidity Providers (LPs) receive a non-fungible token (NFT) called a "liquidity position token" instead of traditional LP tokens. This is because Uniswap V3 introduces the concept of "Concentrated Liquidity" where LPs can choose to provide liquidity within a specified price range.

Okay!!!!

What the hell is Concentrated Liquidity?

**Concentrated Liquidity**

:   This is Uniwap's flagship V3 model that gives Liquidity Providers the option to choose price ranges they deem profitable and are ready to deploy their capital to efficiently reduce impermanent loss.

    This means that liquidity providers can choose to support trading for a specific set of prices, potentially providing more efficient and targeted liquidity for traders. Here, liquidity providers can adjust their liquidity relative to the current prices of the assets under consideration.

Impermanent Loss

:   Impermanent loss is a financial risk that can occur when providing liquidity to an automated market maker (AMM) pool. It occurs when there is a change in the price of a token relative to another token in the pool. The greater the price change, the greater the impermanent loss. Correlation and volatility are the main causes of impermanent loss. It can only be realized when you withdraw your liquidity from the pool. If you leave your liquidity in the pool, you have the potential to earn back the losses you have incurred. However, if the price of the token that has decreased does not recover, you may experience a permanent loss.

## **STRATEGIES FOR LIQUIDITY PROVIDERS (LPs)**

HODL Stable Coins: Hold stable coins to minimize volatility and preserve capital during turbulent market conditions.

HODL 50% of Both Tokens: Hold 50% of two different tokens without providing liquidity, useful for hedging risk between them, especially with tokens having inverse correlations.

HODL 100% of One Token: Hold 100% of a single token if you strongly believe in its potential upside, but this exposes you to significant risk if its value decreases.

Provide Wide Range Liquidity: Set custom price ranges for liquidity provision with a wide price range, reducing the risk of liquidity being outside the trading range but potentially earning lower fees.

Provide Narrow Range Liquidity: Set narrower price ranges for liquidity, increasing capital efficiency and potentially earning more fees, but at the cost of higher risk if the token prices move outside the specified range.

Provide Liquidity in Volatile Token Pools: Provide liquidity in pools with significant price fluctuations, which can be profitable due to high trading volumes but also carries higher risk of impermanent loss.

The effectiveness of these strategies depends on factors like market conditions, asset volatility, and personal risk tolerance, so it's important to assess your circumstances and objectives before choosing a strategy.

## **STRATEGY BACKTESTING**

Strategy back-testing is a critical practice in trading and investment that involves modelling investment strategies using historical market data to estimate their hypothetical profitability. It is based on the assumption that past performance can be used to measure potential future outcomes. While this assumption does not necessarily translates into future gains, it does offer valuable insights that can help make more informed and effective decisions.

Back-testing on Uniswap V3 requires extra effort due to the protocol's unique features such as the advent of Concentrated Liquidity and Liquidity Position Tokens(in this case NFTs), these allow liquidity providers (LPs) to customize their liquidity exposure curve and enhance capital efficiency.

In short, strategy back-testing is a useful tool for evaluating an investment process before putting them into practice.
